<p>I&rsquo;ve spent quite a long time since thinking about this, not least since I&rsquo;m embarking on this journey. It also interests me on a selfish level to consider the longevity of a career in open source, if I am going to embark on one. I figured it may be worth documenting my experiences if it could even make us a little closer as a community to figuring out how to make people want to look at large scary codebases, much less improve on it.</p>
<p>To begin: It&rsquo;s simply not clear what path you ought to be taking to work in your chosen field of interest in open source.</p>
<p>Everyone also comes in with a different level of skill - and beyond that, a different skillset even if we were to assume that everyone was equally skilled. It&rsquo;s hard to figure out what the basic levels of decency is required here: both in quality of code/idea and in communication - is it okay to randomly email a dev? What about a dev of a very respected project? Gosh I would be such a nuisance if I bothered a respected, senior developer like this in a corporate environment.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d get over that quickly because, perhaps the idea of learning more just to be that little bit better of a developer is intriguing to you so you decide you&rsquo;ll learn more about the ecosystem so you can set yourself some targets to achieve but then you&rsquo;d realize &ndash;</p>
<p>Open Source looks very, very old.</p>
<p>This all looked very different from the tools that a Computer Science undergraduate would naturally be shown and be exposed to in their university education. Sure, the code and collaboration system hasn&rsquo;t changed: we don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;why&rdquo; statements instead of &ldquo;if&rdquo; statements; Linus&rsquo; git is still Linus Torvalds&rsquo; git &ndash; but modern, newer codebases that defined my university code submissions (Python&rsquo;s Flask, Javascript&rsquo;s Node.js/Angular, the Apple ecosystem&rsquo;s Objective C) exposed to the average undergraduate look absolutely nothing like codebases that act as representatives for the Open Source community &ndash; the Linux Kernel, Ubuntu or Debian&rsquo;s codebases. They&rsquo;re gargantuan to someone who hasn&rsquo;t seen their first mature codebase (of which I&rsquo;ve least seen in my old work as their intern). Cython or Rust is new, and appear friendlier to new faces but focus on more technical things that might not interest everyone. I didn&rsquo;t start with a Commadore 64 like most of the devs I regularly share a laugh with, I had one of Steve Jobs&rsquo; iMacs G3s &ndash; and none of my beautiful, well UX-researched, designed and re-iterated menus and toy-like chassis ever looked like the command line. Jobs’ influence on UX design told me that command lines are for scary people!</p>
<p>What this all did look similar to, as a youngin, was academia - my only other (sort of) accessible source of Commadore 64-adoring fanatics. I had the fortunate misfortune of initially majoring in a field of biology generally only taught at a postgraduate level, in my undergraduate years. That was the only reason why I had some reference to guide me through this — if nothing else but what was the equivalent of a bricked iPhone with an unlimited data plan in its sim slot</p>
<p>But you spend lots of time understanding the way open source all works anyway &ndash; and it makes you feel accomplished &ndash; but you discover more knowledge that makes you realize what you learnt was a small minutiae in the grand scheme of things. The ability to contribute to Open Source is in a way also, a point of privilege. Certainly if I decided to immerse myself into open source a month earlier I would have not been in a situation where I had the time to learn the ropes of Open Source.</p>
<p>And then you meet loads of people with whom you shared a silly pun with who sent positive energy and that gets you through the first patch</p>
<p>And maybe you’ll even realize that the difference between someone who’s highly technical and who isn’t is simply in the level of comfort behind learning new things all the time</p>
<p>Oh but you&rsquo;re now feeling a little braver and ready to learn to develop for real now and you have no idea where to start on understanding the unsaid and explicit rules of how to best write a pull request for an open source project &ndash; and then it&rsquo;s time to try your hand at a mentorship program (internships in the open source world) like GSOC or a project&rsquo;s self-funded equivalent</p>
<p>It must be pointed out at this point that learning an entirely new development culture: its values, communication tools (and underlying protocols), how to write good code — and most of all how to be a helpful code contributor — oh, and where you find your tribe within a sub-section of this sub-section of technology; would prove difficult regardless of experience. Sure, experience might help you (as it did for me), but our brains just don’t like learning new things, much less all the time — sometimes, many times every day. But once you get the hang of it, you’ll take a liking to this entire process — and maybe, like I did, find a group of people you can comfortably find home in a new ground of likeminded nerds who want no more than to sit in their PJs, bond over shared love for good, thoughtful, and meaningful ideas (and I guess, say some grumpy things to each other sometimes.)</p>
<p>Okay, open source devs aren’t cuddly people — but we certainly are “oh that person gets my grumpiness, whew” kinds of people</p>
<p>In trying to tackle the problem of needing to create a more inviting environment for more people to contribute open source for projects to survive, I now think that you certainly don&rsquo;t have to make open source development appeal to the general developer population &ndash; but what it certainly should try to do is to help along people for whom Open Source as a value system and collaboration method speaks to.</p>
<p>So how would I describe Open Source now that I&rsquo;ve understood a bigger chunk of it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Source is simply a collaboration system, not a financial model, or a development framework. Anything can be open sourced. Beer, tech, art, currency</li>
<li>No one will help you &ndash; caveat: &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t help yourself first</li>
<li>Submitting a pull request means taking a genuine interest in a project and finding something you&rsquo;d want to improve</li>
<li>Respecting the time of developers means respecting the style guide when pushing changes to the codebase</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid of using the very, incredibly old documentation or technical book about something - if it’s appearing high up on your Google search, it’s likely to still be fairly credible</li>
</ul>
